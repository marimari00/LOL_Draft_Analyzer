# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Super Easy Way (Recommended)

**Just double-click this file:**
```
START_HERE.bat
```

That's it! Both servers will start automatically in separate windows.

---

## Alternative: Start Individually

If you want to start them separately:

### Start Backend:
Double-click: `start_backend.bat`

### Start Frontend:
Double-click: `start_frontend.bat`

---

## Accessing the Application

After starting:
- **Frontend:** Browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API:** Running at `http://localhost:8000`

---

## Stopping the Servers

Close the terminal windows that opened, or press `Ctrl+C` in each window.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "npm not recognized"  
**Solution:** Close all PowerShell/CMD windows and try again. Node.js needs a fresh terminal.

**Problem:** Port already in use  
**Solution:** Close any existing backend/frontend terminals first.

---

## What You'll See

1. Two terminal windows open (Backend + Frontend)
2. Backend shows "✓ API ready"
3. Frontend compiles and browser opens
4. Draft board interface loads
5. Start picking champions!

---

**That's it! No command line needed.** 🎮✨
